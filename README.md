# Kogel Numbers

This is a little script for finding Kogel numbers.

To use a file, put it in the `/files/` folder. The file can only contain numbers and nothing else.

### A what?

A Kogel number is a number which value indicates its own position in another number like π. For example, in the number 2.67042, 4 is a Kogel number because it's the fourth digit.

### Output

An output of the script could look like this:
```
Digit : Number
    1 : 1
    1 : 16
    2 : 45
    1 : 61
    1 : 75
```
The first number indicates which digit of the second number corresponds with the place. For example, with `2 : 45`, it's the second digit of 45. That means that the 5 is on the 45th position.
